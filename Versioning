Routing of pages tested in sandbox ([master])
Created structure:
-index.js: <Router><App></Router>
--App: inside<Switch>  are routes to Main +login-like components(they are passed to render of Main comp as props) and route to Fuzzers (fake authorization flag)
---Main:renders back block and login-like component on the right-hand, which has been passed as props
----login-like component (i.e. Registration): uses <Link to='/login'> 
	
Issues with realization: Main component is render each time  login-like component is called by path.
